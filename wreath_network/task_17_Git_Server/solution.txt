1. Excluding the out of scope hosts, and the current host (.200), how many hosts were discovered active on the network?
ans: 2
command: ssh -i id_rsa root@10.200.109.200 (id_rsa is in task_6)
command: python3 -m http.server 80 (host machine)
command: curl 10.50.110.11/nmap-sujal -o ./nmap-sujal (ssh)
command: chmod +x nmap-sujal (ssh)
command: ip a (10.200.109.200) (ssh)
command: ./nmap-sujal -sn 10.200.109.0/24 -oN scan-user.txt (ssh)
	  (10.200.109.150:open, 10.200.109.100:open, 10.200.109.250:openvpn, 10.200.109.200:it-self)

2. In ascending order, what are the last octets of these host IPv4 addresses? (e.g. if the address was 172.16.0.80, submit the 80)
ans: 100,150
     (10.200.109.100:open, 10.200.109.150:open)

3. Scan the hosts -- which one does not return a status of "filtered" for every port (submit the last octet only)?
ans: 150
command: ./nmap-sujal 10.200.109.100 10.200.109.150 -oN open-ipscan-sujal 

4. Which TCP ports (in ascending order, comma separated) below port 15000, are open on the remaining target?
ans: 80,3389,5385
command: ./nmap-sujal 10.200.109.100 10.200.109.150 -oN open-ipscan-sujal

5. Assuming that the service guesses made by Nmap are accurate, which of the found services is more likely to contain an exploitable vulnerability?
ans: http (port 80 is open)

6. Now that we have an idea about the other hosts on the network, we can start looking at some of the tools and techniques we could use to access them!
ans: auto-complete
