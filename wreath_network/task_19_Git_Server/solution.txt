									Git Server Code Review 
								--------------------------------------

1. Look at the information at the top of the script. On what date was this exploit written?
ans: 18.01.2018
command: searchsploit gitstack (we found this in task_18) (attack machine)
command: searchsploit -m php/webapps/43777.py (attack machine)
command: dos2unix 43777.py (because searchsploit use DOS line endings, which can cause problems in scripts when executed on Linux)
command: cat 43777.py | grep -Ri date (attack machine)

2. Bearing this in mind, is the script written in Python2 or Python3?
ans: pyhton2
command: python2 43777.py (i try with python, python2 and python3 but python2 work with thi script)

3. Add an appropriate shebang to the exploit, at the very top of the file!
ans: auto complete
complete: nano 43777.py
	  (in 43777.py i entered "#!/usr/bin/python2" this in very first line)
	
4. Just to confirm that you have been paying attention to the script: What is the name of the cookie set in the POST request 
   made on line 74 (line 73 if you didn't add the shebang) of the exploit? 
ans: csrftoken
command: sed -n '74p' 43777.py | grep -Ri "cookies=" (because i add #!/usr/bin/python2 this line in very first of the file)
