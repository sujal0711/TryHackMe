								Pivoting SSH Tunnelling / Port Forwarding 
							----------------------------------------------------------

1. If you're connecting to an SSH server from your attacking machine to create a port forward, would this be a local (L) port forward or a remote (R) port forward?
ans: l (local)

2. Which switch combination can be used to background an SSH port forward or tunnel?
ans: -fN

3. It's a good idea to enter our own password on the remote machine to set up a reverse proxy, Aye or Nay?
ans: nay

4. What command would you use to create a pair of throwaway SSH keys for a reverse connection?
ans: ssh-keygen

5. If you wanted to set up a reverse portforward from port 22 of a remote machine (172.16.0.100) to port 2222 of your local machine (172.16.0.200),
   using a keyfile called id_rsa and backgrounding the shell, what command would you use? (Assume your username is "kali")
ans: ssh -l 2222:172.16.0.200:20 -i id_rsa kali@172.16.0.100

6. What command would you use to set up a forward proxy on port 8000 to user@target.thm, backgrounding the shell?
ans: ssh -l 8000 user@target.thm -fN

7. If you had SSH access to a server (172.16.0.50) with a webserver running internally on port 80 (i.e. only accessible to the server itself on 127.0.0.1:80), how 
   would you forward it to port 8000 on your attacking machine? Assume the username is "user", and background the shell:.
ans: ssh -l 8000:127.0.0.1:80 user@172.16.0.50 -fN
