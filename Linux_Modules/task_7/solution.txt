																Task:7 sed command 
															---------------------------

1. How would you substitute every 3rd occurrence of the word 'hack' to 'back' on every line inside the file file.txt?
ans: sed 's/hack/back/3g' file.txt

2. How will you do the same operation only on 3rd and 4th line in file.txt?
ans: sed '3,4 s/hack/back/3g' file.txt

3. Download the given file, and try formatting the trailing spaces in sed1.txt with a colon(:).
ans: sed 's/ */:/g' sed1.txt
 
4. View the  sed2 file in the directory. Try putting all alphabetical values together, to get the answer for this question.
ans: CONGRATULATIONS YOU MADE IT THROUGH THIS SMALL LITTLE CHALLENGE
command: sed 's/[[:digit:]]//g' sed2.txt

5. What pattern did you use to reach that answer string?
ans: 's/[[:digit:]]//g'

6. Alternatively, you can use tr to remove all the digits, and then pipe the output in sed to remove trailing whitespaces.
   cat sed2.txt | tr '[:digit:]' ' ' | sed 's/  *//g'
   [Update] Another good way suggested by a room do-er. You can simply use tr -d command to delete all the digits from the file.
   cat sed2.txt | tr -d '[:digit:]'
ans: auto-complete
